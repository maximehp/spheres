- Post sphere progression
- Prestige/rebirth system
- Challenge stages
- Final win at 9 spheres


you complete the first loop and itll stay full (become a different object that is identical but static) and have an animation of shrinking to a specific spot, then a pop up will happen that shows 8 stages with the one you just completed checked off
they arent linear stages, theyre more like challenges, where each one has a handicap, and some are harder than others and reward more points (i can have point recommendations for each)
points will be used for upgrades in this same menu that have overreaching effects that permeate and are more special than standard upgrades
they can be redistributed at whim, but you have to restart your stage to do so
once you finish all 8 stages, you go to a final stage, which is like a 50 or 100 loop sphere, and when you finish that, all the other spheres start circling around the big one and it plays the win animation
